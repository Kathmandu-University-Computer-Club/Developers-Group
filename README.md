# Developers Group
<h2> Nothing new, just doing the old stuffs in a new way!</h2>

<h2> Short Description</h2>
Here at Develovers Group we: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Curate ideas</li>
        This ain't another EUREKA MOMENT when talking about curating ideas. All we do is conduct Brainstroaming sessions(online or cunducting meetings), discuss on existing problems arround our class, department, University and Community and find solutions as a Tech Product
    <li>Work together with members from different Communities for a common Objective.</li>
        Someone among us is a true #GEEK, someone is just a beginner, So what? You need not worry we already have a dozens of communities initiated via KUCC. Join one of them and start learning tools and technologies that you are interested in.
        
Here at Developers Group, we combine all the talents from our Communities( Python, Network, Graphics and Design, Android, Robotics, Raspbyians, AI ML Freaks, Djangos, Wordpress, it keeps adding every year) for a common objective and integrate talents to create/innovate some product.
<li>Create a Friendly Culture within Like MInded KU GUYS</li>
    <i>So everytime you hear this rhyming from the Audience at CV Raman "KU GUYS ALWAYS ROCKS", right? If you didn't you dind't enjoy your KU LIFE haha</i> We will try to groom that friendlyness among every members involved in Developers Group by organizing teambuilding and recreational activities, Khowledge sharing and Technical Demonstration Sessions, Research concept presentation and Paper Citation Sessions.
    <p>    These things barely happens here at KU. You think about a project that'll contribute somehow in solving some environmental issues, but you never knock door of ENE and Environment Science Department's Door and ask for any help of feedback. Guys from Biotechnology, Applied Physics and Natural Science do projects on some mathematical problems but neither they knock DoCSE's door and ask us like hey guys, I have studied this statical analysis algorithm. And I want to simulate this, Can you guys help me with the tools, and syntax.</p>
    <b> Will we be able to create a culture of entertaining among like minded people here at KU and help eachother?</b>
</ul>
